💼 Job Portal System

Introduction

The Job Portal is a web-based application developed as part of a mini project for the B.Voc Data Science program. This system enables job seekers to find relevant job opportunities and apply online while allowing companies to post jobs, manage candidates, and conduct interviews.
The portal supports three types of users: Admin, Company, and Candidate. The admin oversees the entire platform, companies manage job postings and view applicants, while candidates can create resumes, apply for jobs, and participate in interviews. This system digitizes and streamlines the recruitment process by eliminating manual job searching and hiring practices.
